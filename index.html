<h2>Facts about the brain</h2>
<p>
Weight
The brain weighs about three pounds.
Fat
The brain is the fattiest organ in the body, with at least 60% of its dry weight made up of fat.
Pain
The brain doesn't feel pain, even though it's the command center for pain perception in the rest of the body. This
allows for brain surgery to be performed while the patient is awake.
New cells
The brain continues to produce new neurons throughout life, a process called neurogenesis.
Blood vessels
The brain has 100,000 miles of blood vessels, which is enough to circle the earth four times.
Oxygen
The brain uses 20% of the oxygen in your body, which is three times as much as your muscles use. Brain cells start to
die after five minutes without oxygen.
Exercise
Aerobic exercise increases blood flow to the brain, which is good for it.
Left and right brain
The left side of the brain is generally responsible for logic and language, while the right side is responsible for
creativity and intuition.
